# GitHub Actions Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the PR Environment API Server with GitHub Actions to automatically create, update, and remove PR environments.

## Overview

The PR Environment API Server provides an API for managing PR environments. GitHub Actions can use this API to:

1. Create a new PR environment when a PR is opened
2. Update an existing PR environment when a PR is updated
3. Remove a PR environment when a PR is closed

## Prerequisites

- PR Environment API Server installed and running
- Access to GitHub repositories for setting up GitHub Actions
- Tailscale account with OAuth client set up

## Setting Up GitHub Actions

### 1. Set Up Tailscale OAuth for GitHub Actions

To allow GitHub Actions to connect to your Tailscale network:

1. Go to the Tailscale admin console at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/oauth
2. Click "Add OAuth Client"
3. Enter a name (e.g., "GitHub Actions")
4. Set the redirect URL to `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`
5. Save the client
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

Add these credentials to your GitHub repository secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
5. Value: Your Tailscale OAuth Client ID
6. Click "Add secret"
7. Click "New repository secret" again
8. Name: `TS_OAUTH_SECRET`
9. Value: Your Tailscale OAuth Client Secret
10. Click "Add secret"

### 2. Add GCP Credentials (if using GCP Container Registry)

If you're using Google Cloud Platform's Container Registry, add your GCP credentials as a GitHub secret:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `GCP_CREDENTIALS`
5. Value: Your GCP credentials JSON
6. Click "Add secret"

### 3. Create the GitHub Actions Workflow File

Create a file at `.github/workflows/pr-environment.yml` in your repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: PR Environment

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]

jobs:
  pr-environment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set environment variables
        id: env
        run: |
          echo "SERVICE_NAME=$(echo ${{ github.repository }} | cut -d '/' -f 2)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "PR_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "PR_ACTION=${{ github.event.action }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "DOMAIN=${SERVICE_NAME}-pr-${PR_NUMBER}.tailf31c84.ts.net" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # Handle PR opened/updated
      - name: Setup GCP credentials
        if: github.event.action != 'closed'
        uses: google-github-actions/auth@v1
        with:
          credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCP_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        if: github.event.action != 'closed'
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Login to GCP Container Registry
        if: github.event.action != 'closed'
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:

          oauth-secret: ${{ secrets.TS_OAUTH_SECRET }}
          tags: tag:github-actions

      - name: Create/Update PR environment
        if: github.event.action != 'closed'
        run: |
          # Create or update the environment
          curl -X POST https://pr-env-api.tailf31c84.ts.net/api/environments \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{

              "pr_number": ${{ steps.env.outputs.PR_NUMBER }},
              "image_url": "europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/vertuoza-qa/vertuoza/${{ steps.env.outputs.SERVICE_NAME }}:pr-${{ steps.env.outputs.PR_NUMBER }}"
            }'

      - name: Comment on PR
        if: github.event.action != 'closed'
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            const url = `https://${{ steps.env.outputs.DOMAIN }}`;

            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: ${{ steps.env.outputs.PR_NUMBER }},
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: `ðŸš€ PR environment deployed at: ${url}\n\nThis environment will be automatically updated when you push new commits to this PR.`
            });

      # Handle PR closed
      - name: Remove PR environment
        if: github.event.action == 'closed'
        run: |
          curl -X DELETE https://pr-env-api.tailf31c84.ts.net/api/environments/${{ steps.env.outputs.SERVICE_NAME }}-pr-${{ steps.env.outputs.PR_NUMBER }}

      - name: Comment on PR about removal
        if: github.event.action == 'closed'
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: ${{ steps.env.outputs.PR_NUMBER }},
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: `ðŸ§¹ PR environment has been removed.`
            });
```

### 4. Customize the Workflow

Customize the workflow file as needed for your repository:

- Update the Docker image registry if needed
- Adjust the environment variables
- Modify the PR comment template

## Project Structure

The PR Environment API Server follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

### Utils

- `utils/commandExecutor.js`: Handles shell command execution with proper error handling
- `utils/fileSystem.js`: Provides file system operations with consistent error handling and logging
- `utils/environmentConfig.js`: Manages environment configuration, IDs, paths, and URLs
- `utils/logger.js`: Centralized logging functionality

### Services

- `services/environmentService.js`: High-level environment management that orchestrates other services
- `services/dockerComposeService.js`: Docker Compose specific operations for environment setup and management

### Routes

- `routes/environments.js`: API endpoints for environment management

## Testing the Integration

Create a pull request in your repository to test the integration. The GitHub Actions workflow should:

1. Build a Docker image for your PR
2. Call the PR Environment API Server to create a PR environment
3. Comment on the PR with the environment URL

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Workflow Not Running

- Check that the workflow file is in the correct location (`.github/workflows/pr-environment.yml`)
- Check that the workflow file has the correct syntax
- Check that GitHub Actions is enabled for your repository

### API Server Not Responding

- Check that the PR Environment API Server is running
- Check that the API server is accessible from GitHub Actions

### PR Environment Not Created

- Check the GitHub Actions logs for error messages
- Check the PR Environment API Server logs for error messages
- Check that the Docker image was built and pushed successfully

### Tailscale Connection Issues

- Check that the Tailscale OAuth credentials are correct
- Verify that the GitHub Actions runner has been added to your Tailscale network
- Check the Tailscale ACLs to ensure the GitHub Actions runner has access to the PR Environment API Server
- Look for Tailscale connection errors in the GitHub Actions logs

## Advanced Configuration

### Using a Different Container Registry

If you're using a different container registry, update the workflow file accordingly:

```yaml
- name: Login to Docker Hub
  if: github.event.action != 'closed'
  uses: docker/login-action@v2
  with:
    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

- name: Build and push Docker image
  if: github.event.action != 'closed'
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
  with:
    context: .
    push: true
    tags: yourusername/yourrepo:pr-${{ steps.env.outputs.PR_NUMBER }}
```

### Using a Different Domain

If you're using a different domain, update the workflow file accordingly:

```yaml
- name: Set environment variables
  id: env
  run: |
    echo "SERVICE_NAME=$(echo ${{ github.repository }} | cut -d '/' -f 2)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo "PR_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo "PR_ACTION=${{ github.event.action }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo "DOMAIN=${SERVICE_NAME}-pr-${PR_NUMBER}.yourdomain.com" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### Using a Different API Server URL

If your API server is at a different URL, update the workflow file accordingly:

```yaml
- name: Create/Update PR environment
  if: github.event.action != 'closed'
  run: |
    # ... (rest of the step)
    curl -X POST https://your-api-server-url/api/environments \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        # ... (rest of the request body)
      }'
